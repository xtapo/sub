1
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:09,083
It's a long story. Coffee?

2
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:17,000
"Blindly"

3
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,708
You aren't hurt, are you?

4
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,792
- Hey, Bandu!
— I'll get you a rickshaw.

5
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,792
It'll cost you a tenner.

6
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,417
Here!

7
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,625
|'|| string you up by your undies
if you try that again. Got it?

8
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,458
- OK. Get me an auto.
— Auto!

9
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:15,958
Maestro!

10
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,167
- Hi!
- Come!

11
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,083
I've got you two new pupils.

12
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,833
- No, sir. Cancel all my lessons.
- How come?

13
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,250
That Viman Nagar kid drives me nuts.

14
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,958
And Mrs. Gokhale gropes me.

15
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,375
- Aabha Gokhale?
- Yes.

16
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:34,375
Her fingers keep playing me
instead of the piano.

17
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:38,958
The competition‘s in 2 months.
I need time to practice.

18
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,750
There's this piece, can't crack it.

19
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,875
Abba Gokhale is your ticket
to London. Keep her sweet.

20
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,042
I need inspiration, not perspiration.

21
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,250
When you’re blind,
days and nights are the same.

22
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:59,458
And if you listen closely,
there’s music in every sound.

23
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,125
Hi, Akash.
Here's your chicken tikka sub.

24
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,500
And your iced tea.
Just the way you like it.

25
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,167
Thank you.

26
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:12,333
The disadvantages of blindness
are known.

27
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:15,500
I'll tell you what the advantage is.
Focus.

28
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,500
For artists focus is everything.

29
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:21,208
I search for my muse
all daylong...

30
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:25,542
...come home and I’m still searching.

31
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:36,542
Though art gives artists a lot,
it extracts a high price.

32
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:41,542
You’re the rain to quench
my thirst

33
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:45,375
I've waited for you forever

34
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:48,375
YOU came, peace came

35
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,083
My sweet love

36
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:08,167
"Awesome song.
Where are you, Pramod Sinha?"

37
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,542
A comment from Denmark.

38
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,042
Hamlet's neck of the woods?

39
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,292
Yes, darling

40
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,708
Daani is on the line.

41
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,292
- Hi, darling.
- Hi, Aunty.

42
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,417
I hear you're off scuba diving?

43
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,625
Yeah! Classes start next week.

44
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,708
ls Dad exercising?

45
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,417
Relax! He jogs for a full hour
every day.

46
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:06,750
- OK, Bye, aunty.
— Bye.

47
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:14,208
Why does she keep calling me "aunty?"
Why not Simi?

48
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,083
She‘s just a kid.
Cut her some slack.

49
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:22,750
We've been married for 3 years, Pramod.
How much more slack?

50
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,792
Now for the main course...

51
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:35,292
Put a crab into boiling water
and you'll kill it.

52
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,250
But I don't want to shock it.

53
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,125
So, two hours before cooking...

54
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,375
...I put it in the deep freezer.

55
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,625
And when it's fast asleep...

56
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:54,500
...I take it out...

57
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:58,208
...and gently put it in boiling water.

58
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,000
They say crabmeat is an aphrodisiac.

59
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,875
Don't ask me to spell it.

60
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,208
But I'll show you what it means.

61
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:17,958
Spicy! I love it!

62
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,333
Fantastic!

63
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,417
You've made my day.

64
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,500
You should have your own show.
Shall I talk to my TV friends?

65
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,708
"Sizzling Hot Simi."

66
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,708
A bunch of lies!

67
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:39,125
How dare you come into my room
and talk to me like that?

68
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,708
What do you take me for?

69
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:43,125
Simi, one sec.
Water?

70
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,875
Don't come near me.

71
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,417
I know why you're here.

72
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,500
Want to poison me?

73
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,500
It's not easy getting rid of me.

74
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,333
What? Why aren't you recording?

75
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:02,292
Pammi, you idiot!
I was auditioning.

76
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,708
For "Nurse Radha," part 2.

77
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,250
Opening scene.

78
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:09,792
Nurse Radha escapes
from the mental asylum.

79
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,875
We can make it low budget.

80
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:18,333
Talk to your film friends.

81
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,125
Oh my God!

82
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,500
Simi! You're something else.

83
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,167
Are you blind? Can't you see
my yellow scooter?

84
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,125
I'm talking to you! Hello!

85
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,250
Wind your window down!
Don't put your specs on.

86
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,667
You idiot!

87
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,208
I'll take your photo to show
the police. Nutcase!

88
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,958
I'm so sorry.

89
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,208
Are you hurt?
I'm so sorry.

90
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,333
I'm really sorry. You 0k?

91
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,708
Can I give you a lift?
How can I help?

92
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,375
Where are you going?

93
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:08,583
It's here. Coffee, sandwich.

94
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,417
Madam, I've had my breakfast.
I'm good.

95
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,542
I'm not. My heart is racing.

96
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,833
Sugar?

97
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:19,208
Why are you crossing the road alone?
Can't you get a guide dog?

98
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:21,708
My cat's enough of a handful.

99
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:25,042
Drink your coffee.
What if you were hurt?

100
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,250
End of a great artist's career
before it starts.

101
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,792
- Artist? What do you do?
— | play the piano.

102
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,833
Piano? Do you play well?

103
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,708
- He
y, you!
- Sir?

104
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:43,083
You leave the storeroom door open
every night.

105
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,500
- Forgot, sir. Sorry.
— Sorry? Every time, sorry.

106
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,500
What's this? I don't like it.

107
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,167
Where have you brought me, Sophie?

108
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,125
- Meet my Dad.
— Hello, sir. How are you?

109
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,583
Franco.
Where did you find him?

110
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,917
- By accident.
— Free in the evenings?

111
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,917
By the way, if you don't mind -
what happened to your eyes?

112
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,625
I got hit by a cricket ball
when I was 14.

113
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:41,833
What's that?

114
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,625
A cricket ball hit my eye
when I was 14.

115
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:46,375
The optic nerve was damaged.

116
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,375
Can we talk about something
more cheerful?

117
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:50,875
Of course.

118
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:54,625
The tips at Franco's won't
even cover your auto fare home.

119
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:57,958
Here we are.

120
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,708
Prabhat Road. Lane 4.

121
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,958
- What's this place?
— An NGO's, for the handicapped.

122
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,417
I'm here for three months.
Guess how much rent I pay?

123
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,417
500—rupees a month.

124
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:15,417
I sense trees everywhere.

125
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,708
I wake up to a symphony
of birdsong.

126
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:22,583
Here are the stairs.
Eighteen steps.

127
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:27,667
Coffee?

128
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,667
Not today. I have tons to do.
I can pick you up at five?

129
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,542
Thanks.

130
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,042
Your piece was fantastic.
IlovediL

131
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:47,833
I'll finish it today.

132
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,250
- It didn't seem unfinished.
- But it is.

133
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,583
Some things are better unfinished.

134
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:58,792
Don't tinker too much. You'll spoil it.
See you.

135
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,250
I mean I‘ll be seeing you.
Bye.

136
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,625
I'll be down in 2 minutes.

137
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,292
Hey, good evening.

138
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,208
- How are you?
- I'm good.

139
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,083
Oh s#**!

140
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:56,542
- Some bird goo on your glasses.
- Lots of birds here.

141
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:10,250
Your eyes look very normal.
Are you completely blind?

142
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:13,750
No. I can tell day from night.

143
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:15,500
Shall I tell you the time?

144
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:19,250
I think it's about 5.30.

145
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,208
Anyway, bird bombs are very lucky.

146
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,417
l have just seen a lovely face

147
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:46,708
Though I don’t know how to read it

148
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:53,000
Deep in the ocean,
/ felt my heart drowning.

149
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,958
l was struck down
from that moment to this

150
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,875
My innocent eyes are hardly
to blame

151
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,333
0 heart of mine, tell me

152
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,750
My innocent eyes are hardly
to blame

153
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:27,083
0 heart of mine, tell me

154
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,292
- Fabulous! Too good.
— Thank you, sir.

155
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,167
He's going to be a big star.

156
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,875
You have a gift.

157
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,333
Not everyone is gifted.

158
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:58,333
Sir, your voice resembles
the actor Pramod Sinha's.

159
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:01,208
You know him?

160
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:04,417
I saw one of his movies on TV
when l was a kid.

161
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,500
What was it called?
"Annadaata."

162
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,792
The songs are terrific too.

163
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,833
Come and give me a hug!

164
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:14,000
- Take a shot of us, Sophie.
— Smile!

165
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:18,833
- We're home.
— Thank you.

166
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,458
You've earned 4000 in tips today.
A record for Franco's!

167
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,333
I'm hoping to earn 200,000
so I can go to London.

168
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,833
All the best.

169
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,875
- Good night.
— Good night.

170
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,500
- Akash?

171
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,500
- You're here early?
— I came to practice.

172
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,417
- OK.
— Guide me.

173
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,083
This must be the corridor.

174
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:11,750
|'|| manage.

175
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:23,458
/ tied my heart in knots

176
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,000
But the Wicked fellow escaped

177
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:33,125
What has come over me?

178
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,875
Sometimes this heart races,
sometimes it quickens

179
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,792
What has happened to me?

180
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:48,042
What had to happen has happened

181
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:53,958
When hearts meet,
they fit like hand in glove

182
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,542
What are you looking at?

183
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:00,917
No burning lamp, no shining light

184
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:04,917
My innocent eyes are hardly
to blame

185
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:10,958
0 heart of mine, tell me

186
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:28,083
My darling girl

187
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,208
What's your name?

188
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,583
/ see you with eyes closed

189
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,083
Your lover salutes you

190
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:44,000
The poor heart has run amok...

191
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:52,083
...since last Monday night maybe

192
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:57,417
In my heart of hearts,
it’s you that / find

193
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:34,083
- Hi, Akash.
— Hi, Pramod sir.

194
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:35,750
Can you play my songs?

195
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,083
I'll just play...

196
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,917
No, no. Not here.
Come to my house tomorrow.

197
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:43,292
For a private concert
for my wife and me.

198
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,875
She loves the star Rajesh Khanna.
Play his numbers. She'll be happy.

199
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:48,917
Sure, sir.

200
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,833
Here's my address.
And an advance. You'll get more later.

201
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:56,042
Hi, sir. Can I get you a drink?

202
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:58,792
No, darling, I'm driving.

203
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,042
One o'clock. Bye bye.

204
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,792
- One o'clock?
- It's a secret.

205
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:26,958
- Inspector, behave yourself.
- I'm sorry, sir.

206
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:32,792
Simi! Watch this scene,
it's great fun.

207
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:34,333
Look!

208
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,833
Pammi, I've seen it ten times.

209
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,208
Now this bimbo will get murdered.

210
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,917
How many times have you seen it?
A thousand?

211
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm going to Bengaluru tomorrow.

212
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:48,708
Have I upset you?

213
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:52,000
Tomorrow's our wedding anniversary!
You're going away?

214
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:58,208
Shetty called. I have urgent work.
I'll be back by the evening flight.

215
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:06,708
As you can see, this is my den.

216
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,833
Sorry, you can't see it.

217
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:11,125
The switch is over there.

218
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,750
Shall I close the door?

219
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:23,000
Can you open this for me?

220
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,167
Thanks.

221
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:30,958
Shall I get a towel?

222
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:33,917
- Could I borrow a T-shirt?
- Sure.

223
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,042
- Here...
— Thank you.

224
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:08,625
I'll just come.

225
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:42,833
Do you have a bottle opener?

226
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:45,875
Cheers to secrets!

227
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,625
Cheers to the Pune rain!

228
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,458
Cheers to your music!

229
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:55,542
Cheers to you! My muse.
Beat that.

230
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,333
Now your turn to say
something awesome.

231
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:01,875
- More wine? No.
— Cheers!

232
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:04,000
Cheers to Kishore Kumar.

233
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,417
- You win.
— What's this?

234
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,208
An eye mask? Is it yours?

235
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:16,667
I can't get to sleep at nights
sometimes.

236
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,125
So I use the mask to force
my eyes shut.

237
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:24,708
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

238
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,500
Why are you dropping things?

239
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:30,458
- Looking for my wine glass.
— It must be where you left it.

240
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:36,750
- This is really difficult.
— What is difficult?

241
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:39,083
I thought I'd left it there.

242
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,083
Careful. You'll break the glass.

243
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,167
Broken glass is lucky.

244
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:46,875
I've found your glass.

245
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,000
Where is it?

246
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:58,167
Why the eye mask?
Are you serious?

247
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:03,875
Describe me.
How do you think I look?

248
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:46,125
Oh God!

249
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:52,500
Good morning.

250
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:59,542
Let's have breakfast at
the Law College canteen.

251
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:04,458
This is the best omelette ever.

252
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:08,125
No Oscar for your performance.

253
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,417
It's the truth.

254
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,542
Can you see me to the door?

255
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:57,708
- Yes?
— Good afternoon.

256
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,250
Pramod Sinha asked me here.

257
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,750
My husband is not at home.

258
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:03,458
Mrs. Sinha, happy anniversary!

259
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:06,792
I'm Akash, the pianist from Franco's.

260
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,958
- For the private concert.
- Private concert?

261
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:12,125
But he's gone to Bengaluru.
He'll be back tomorrow.

262
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:13,583
He called me today.

263
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,833
At one o'clock.
Sorry, I'm early.

264
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,333
Maybe you got the date wrong.

265
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:21,542
It was today for sure.
He paid me an advance.

266
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,083
It was a surprise.

267
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,292
I shouldn't have told you.

268
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:27,583
Could you call him?

269
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:30,667
Is that him?

270
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:36,167
Come inside.

271
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:49,375
|'|| phone Pramod.

272
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:58,708
Pammi, did you calla piano player
from Franco's?

273
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:04,125
My God! You should've told me.

274
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:06,208
I'm not even properly dressed.

275
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:09,458
OK. Come home soon.

276
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:15,417
He'll be here in 10 minutes.

277
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:18,417
Yes, ma'am. Awonderful mini grand.
Beautiful.

278
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:23,750
Are you completely blind?

279
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:27,417
- Or can you see partially?
— I'm completely blind, ma'am.

280
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:31,583
A cricket ball hit my eye when I was 14
and damaged the optic nerve.

281
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:36,333
In spite of that, you play music?

282
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,292
My hearing is absolutely fine.

283
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:42,250
- Play something.
- Sure.

284
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:20,250
Wow!

285
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:23,083
Lovely!

286
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:26,708
What a lovely surprise
my husband has given me.

287
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:29,167
He's still so romantic.

288
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:33,083
Ma'am, may I use your bathroom?

289
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:38,167
Sure.

290
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,458
Left.

291
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:08,250
Surprise!

292
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,625
Beautiful.

293
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:05,458
Beautiful.

294
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:43,667
Looks like Pammi is here.

295
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:53,583
Wow! You're such a darling.

296
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:58,458
Thank you for the lovely gift.

297
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:01,167
He plays so beautifully.

298
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:22,708
Fantastic!
You've made my day.

299
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:24,583
Thank you, sir.

300
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,250
Shall I talk to my TV friends?
You should have your own show.

301
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:28,833
Pammi, let's go inside.

302
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,208
I want to show you
what I got you.

303
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:32,708
Wo w!

304
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:41,167
Pammi, this is too much.

305
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,375
I'm not talking to you any more.

306
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,708
What anniversary is this?

307
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:47,083
You just got here. How can you go?

308
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,375
Mad at me?

309
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,458
Pammi, you could‘ve
taken the day off today.

310
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:55,542
You‘d better come home
in 20 minutes.

311
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,125
He's waiting for you.

312
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:02,083
OK, bye, Pammi.

313
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:10,667
He had to sign off a deal
with a builder.

314
00:42:11,042 --> 00:42:12,750
He says it's his lucky day.

315
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,125
Some fruit juice?

316
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:18,208
No, ma'am. I'm fine.
Thank you.

317
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:38,292
Pramod will be home late.
You'd better go.

318
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:40,750
Do I owe you anything?

319
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:43,667
It's OK, ma'am. Sir will pay me.

320
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:04,667
Lottery tickets for sale!
Try your luck, sir.

321
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:06,500
Go on, buy one!

322
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:10,417
Sahab, do me a favour.

323
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Put your hand on any ticket.
They say God favours the blind.

324
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:18,875
He touched the ticket.

325
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,042
You'll hit the jackpot!

326
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,667
Out with 100-rupees.

327
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,542
Thank you. A cup of tea?

328
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:28,708
No tea. Get me an auto.

329
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,208
Hey, get your auto out.

330
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,083
Give him a ride.

331
00:44:33,042 --> 00:44:34,333
- Hurry up!
- Coming.

332
00:44:36,417 --> 00:44:37,750
My bag!

333
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:40,500
- Where to?
— The police station.

334
00:44:46,667 --> 00:44:47,667
Where to?

335
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:51,583
Come. This way.

336
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:55,458
Careful.

337
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,208
Sir, he wants to file a complaint.

338
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:00,583
What complaint?

339
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,958
I want to report a murder.

340
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,458
Who was murdered?

341
00:45:13,417 --> 00:45:14,958
Some water, please.

342
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,250
No sweat. The boss is here.

343
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:26,333
So, who was murdered?

344
00:45:27,417 --> 00:45:31,042
- Rani, sir.
— Rani? Who is Rani?

345
00:45:31,542 --> 00:45:32,458
My cat.

346
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:36,042
The neighbourhood kid was after her.
He must be the culprit.

347
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:40,083
You think we're crazy,
to look for a cat-killer?

348
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:41,458
Shut it!

349
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:45,833
- Did you witness the murder?
— But I'm blind, sir.

350
00:45:46,667 --> 00:45:48,042
I'll find your cat.

351
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:51,083
Back again?

352
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,750
- Where do you live?
- On Prabhat Road.

353
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:10,792
Your phone was off.
I've waited hours.

354
00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:12,583
Your blasted phone was off.

355
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:16,417
Couldn't you tell me
you were busy, Manu?

356
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,875
Sweetheart, I had a meeting.

357
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:21,458
You're too much.
Always the same story.

358
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:23,958
An urgent case has come up.
Sorry.

359
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,083
Let's talk tonight.

360
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:34,708
Hello, ma‘am.

361
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,958
What urgent case?

362
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:40,875
- He's looking for a cat.
- A cat?

363
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,667
- What colour is your cat?
— Sir, black and white.

364
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:47,750
How do you know?

365
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:50,208
I was told.

366
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:56,250
Sir, coffee?

367
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:16,042
You cook for yourself?

368
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,083
Forget about me, sir.

369
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,708
Rani might get run over.

370
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:21,917
- Water.
- Chilled, sir?

371
00:47:33,292 --> 00:47:34,042
The water...

372
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:51,458
Today's newspaper? Who for?

373
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,208
To collect cat poo, sir.

374
00:48:06,792 --> 00:48:08,792
Sir!

375
00:48:20,792 --> 00:48:22,042
You're here?

376
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:25,500
Please look for Rani.
I'm lost without her.

377
00:48:26,417 --> 00:48:28,500
Sir, Bandu's school bus.

378
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:30,458
Box his ears! Then he'll talk.

379
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:34,667
Last week he tied a firecracker
to Rani's tail. She ran amok.

380
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:36,208
She hid indoors for two days.

381
00:48:36,542 --> 00:48:37,875
That's no good.

382
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:41,083
She was really scared.

383
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:44,042
What was that?

384
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:46,625
Rani? My baby.

385
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:48,417
Rani!

386
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,667
Where were you?

387
00:48:51,167 --> 00:48:53,417
Come, baby, come.
Eat something.

388
00:48:54,708 --> 00:48:56,292
You haven't eaten for two days.

389
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:57,917
Thank you, sir.

390
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,083
Good girl!

391
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,125
Are you OK?

392
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:20,917
- Hi, Franco.
— Hey, Simi. Happy anniversary!

393
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:24,250
- Where's the boss?
— Late as usual.

394
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:26,083
|'|| phone him.

395
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:33,417
- Red wine?
— Thanks. That'll be lovely.

396
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:35,208
Sophie!

397
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:43,000
Happy anniversary, ma'am.
How are you?

398
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,333
Your piano player is gifted.

399
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:51,333
Fantastic, isn't he?

400
00:49:53,542 --> 00:49:54,875
Your boyfriend?

401
00:49:58,333 --> 00:50:00,333
Ma'am, we've ordered your cake.

402
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:03,208
- A diabetic cake?
- Yes.

403
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,000
Please enjoy your drink.

404
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:57,167
- Seen Akash?
— He just left in an auto.

405
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:12,083
I'll never return to see you again

406
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:19,875
Breaking news from Pune.
The 19703 film star...

407
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:22,375
...Pramod Sinha was shot last night.

408
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:26,667
Near the Indrayani river in Pune....

409
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,375
...is where his car and body
were found.

410
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:33,917
His film credits include Spy of Shanghai,
Nurse Radha, The Boy Next Door.

411
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:39,167
Superhit films.
After retiring from acting...

412
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:41,333
...he joined the real estate business.

413
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:47,417
According to his wife, Simi Sinha,
he left home with ten million rupees...

414
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:50,625
...to close a property deal.

415
00:51:50,792 --> 00:51:52,250
But he never returned.

416
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:56,500
The police investigation is continuing.

417
00:51:56,708 --> 00:52:01,583
Despite the government's new rules.
large cash transactions...

418
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:06,167
...are still the order of the day.
The truth is...

419
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:23,958
On my mother's life,
I know nothing.

420
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:27,167
- Where did you find the watch?
- In the men's toilet, sir.

421
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:31,000
I swear! I've gone clean.

422
00:52:31,167 --> 00:52:35,333
I know nothing, sir.
On my mother's life, I know nothing.

423
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:41,542
Are you sure this is Mr. Sinha's watch?

424
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:46,708
I gave it to Dad on his last birthday.

425
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:49,042
Any progress?

426
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,208
He'll talk soon enough.

427
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:57,750
Sir, he's the piano player.

428
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:02,208
You must be Akash.

429
00:53:02,417 --> 00:53:04,167
Yes. And you are?

430
00:53:04,917 --> 00:53:06,250
I'm Daani.

431
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,000
Papa told me about you.

432
00:53:09,542 --> 00:53:11,000
He even sent me a photo.

433
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:14,583
You were the last to see him.

434
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:17,750
Was he well?

435
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:19,792
He was...

436
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:22,333
He was very cheerful.

437
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:24,792
He was such a happy person.

438
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Kamdar!

439
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:30,083
Read Akash his statement.
He'll sign it.

440
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:33,708
"On 27 June 2018, Sinha asked me
to play the piano at his home...

441
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:35,917
"...for his wedding anniversary.

442
00:53:36,167 --> 00:53:37,875
"I arrived there at one sharp.

443
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:39,958
"Pramodji came ten minutes later.

444
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:43,917
"We spoke briefly but he had
to rush away to meet a builder..."

445
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:45,417
All lies!

446
00:53:45,417 --> 00:53:49,833
They shot him. Stuffed his body in a bag.
Snapped a finger to remove his ring.

447
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,833
- I can see. Look at my eyes. I can see!
- Catch him!

448
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,708
Daani, they're having an affair.

449
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:59,292
- He's talking utter rubbish.
- You're the liar.

450
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:04,542
"I waited for a while
but he did not come back.

451
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:09,167
"At 2pm, Mrs. Sinha asked me to leave."

452
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:20,500
May the days pass

453
00:54:20,833 --> 00:54:23,625
May the seconds tick by

454
00:54:29,875 --> 00:54:32,542
Lost in memories of her

455
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:35,667
Lost in her words

456
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:38,500
Lost when / see her

457
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:42,458
Since the day we met...

458
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:46,583
...co/our floods my dreams

459
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:50,125
May the days pass...

460
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,125
Thank you.

461
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:04,708
Pramod always used to say...

462
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,417
"Bury the past, think of the future."

463
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:16,458
But today when I look ahead,
I see no future.

464
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,083
He left me all alone
on our wedding anniversary.

465
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,042
He asked Akash over as a surprise.
But my husband came home late.

466
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:30,625
He talked to us briefly then he left.

467
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:34,917
Just as he was leaving, he said:

468
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,167
"Simi, I'll be right back."

469
00:55:57,917 --> 00:56:01,125
I'm so sorry to hear the news.
| just couldn't believe it.

470
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:07,667
Daani darling, take care of yourself.
Come and see me.

471
00:56:39,042 --> 00:56:42,042
- Simi told you a bunch of lies.
- Lies?

472
00:56:42,375 --> 00:56:44,000
Pramod was not late.

473
00:56:44,292 --> 00:56:46,083
I saw everything.

474
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:48,125
A man showed up first...

475
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:51,125
...then Pramod arrived.

476
00:56:51,417 --> 00:56:55,292
The man was inside in the house
when the piano player got there.

477
00:56:55,667 --> 00:56:57,917
- Who are you?
- Mrs. D'Sa.

478
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:02,667
I'm the principal of St Anne's.
And Pramod's neighbour.

479
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:06,917
Pramod and my husband
were close friends.

480
00:57:07,167 --> 00:57:10,917
They must be enjoying a drink together
in heaven.

481
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:13,833
Go on.

482
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:19,125
I returned home from the post office.
A man was in the lift with me.

483
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:21,292
He went into Pramod's flat.

484
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:26,000
He was inside when Pramod arrived
with gifts in hand.

485
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:30,000
The blind piano player
was the last man to arrive.

486
00:57:30,667 --> 00:57:35,250
Wrong! The blind man arrived first,
and then Mr. Sinha.

487
00:57:35,667 --> 00:57:41,042
No! I'm telling you, there was already
a third man in the house.

488
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,917
A third man? What man?

489
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:49,375
He resembled a builder...| mean
a body builder.

490
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:52,833
I could identify him
if I saw him again.

491
00:57:53,292 --> 00:57:56,958
- Body builder? A third man?
- Yes!

492
00:57:57,458 --> 00:57:59,375
Ask Simi.

493
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:05,792
She's over there.
Ask her. Make it sound casual.

494
00:58:06,292 --> 00:58:07,208
Go on.

495
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:23,292
That was Papa's favourite song.

496
00:58:26,292 --> 00:58:27,583
Will you teach it to me?

497
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:29,833
Of course.

498
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:31,833
A third man?

499
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:36,500
Last week? You mean
the pizza delivery boy?

500
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,167
He delivered the pizza,
then a little later Pramod arrived.

501
00:58:40,375 --> 00:58:44,667
Actually, Mrs. D'Sa is trying to help.
She's a fan of Pramod's.

502
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:48,708
Too many crank calls.

503
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:50,833
The last caller was the limit.

504
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:53,542
He said it was Manohar sir...

505
00:58:54,167 --> 00:58:56,375
...who dumped Sinha's body
on the bridge.

506
00:58:58,833 --> 00:59:01,250
What's wrong? Easy!

507
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:04,250
I'm fine, thank you.

508
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:07,542
People are just jealous of him.
Manu has many enemies.

509
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
| read you've arrested a chap
called Surya.

510
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:16,750
He won't tell us where he's hidden the
ten million. Sir will make him talk.

511
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:19,708
Sorry, but may I say something?

512
00:59:20,167 --> 00:59:22,958
You shouldn't cross Simi off
the list of suspects.

513
00:59:23,208 --> 00:59:26,000
After all, why did she marry Sinha?

514
00:59:26,792 --> 00:59:29,417
With such an age gap?
A love marriage?

515
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:33,167
Sure, he's rich.

516
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:37,583
But what about the rest?
She must have a lover.

517
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:41,542
Mrs. D'Sa was implying that.

518
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:45,417
- Mrs. D'Sa?
— Pramod Sinha's neighbour.

519
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:49,167
She insists a third man was present.

520
00:59:49,917 --> 00:59:52,833
- She says she can identify him.
- Get a sketch done.

521
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:57,708
Sinha's murder is a high profile case.

522
00:59:57,875 --> 01:00:00,667
Solve it and you will all get promoted.

523
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:05,083
- Let's bring in Mrs. D'Sa.
— Best.

524
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:07,958
She's old.
We better go to her place.

525
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:10,417
I'm going to the washroom.

526
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:13,083
You left the eggs.

527
01:00:15,292 --> 01:00:18,000
He eats 16 eggs a day. For protein.

528
01:00:26,125 --> 01:00:28,875
- Akash.
— Sophie, is everything OK?

529
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,292
You tell me.

530
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:35,042
Why are you behaving so strangely?
You've been avoiding me.

531
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:38,750
Daani wants me to notate
her Dad's song. Talk later?

532
01:00:41,917 --> 01:00:45,500
That night was not out of sympathy.
Nor was it casual.

533
01:00:45,917 --> 01:00:48,250
What was it for you?

534
01:00:48,417 --> 01:00:52,750
This invisible tension doesn't suit me.
I break out in spots.

535
01:00:54,667 --> 01:00:56,125
To Magarpatta.

536
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:05,583
Can you buy some balm from
the Chemist's?

537
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:07,583
Sure.

538
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:31,958
Have you something for a headache,
Mrs. D'Sa?

539
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:34,250
Yes. One minute.

540
01:01:57,333 --> 01:01:58,917
Simi, are you all right?

541
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:44,958
- Is there running water here?
- 24/7.

542
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:47,333
- Amenities?
- The works.

543
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:50,917
She fell from the 7th floor.
We've found her glasses, sir.

544
01:02:51,417 --> 01:02:54,625
She must have lost her balance.
The balcony floor was wet.

545
01:02:55,042 --> 01:02:56,458
She was 81.

546
01:02:57,625 --> 01:02:59,958
Isn't she the woman we wanted
to question?

547
01:03:00,292 --> 01:03:01,500
A pity.

548
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:04,542
I've known Mrs. D'Sa since childhood.

549
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,292
Move back! Come on.

550
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:20,250
What are you doing here?
We'll be late for the prayer meet.

551
01:04:09,542 --> 01:04:12,958
Sophie, I have something urgent
to tell you. Come soon.

552
01:04:29,042 --> 01:04:30,417
Rani!

553
01:05:00,292 --> 01:05:01,667
Yes?

554
01:05:02,292 --> 01:05:03,958
Can I come in?

555
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:07,750
Who is it? Mrs. Sinha?
Please come.

556
01:05:07,958 --> 01:05:10,625
Daani was looking for you at the temple.
Where were you?

557
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:13,000
VVhy?

558
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:19,458
There was a prayer meet for Pramod.
Didn't she tell you?

559
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:23,292
Here, have the prasad.

560
01:05:26,958 --> 01:05:28,167
Please sit.

561
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:32,542
Actually...

562
01:05:33,875 --> 01:05:35,833
...I wanted to thank you personally.

563
01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:41,750
You've really helped Daani.
She's suffering from shock.

564
01:05:42,542 --> 01:05:43,833
She‘s a lovely girl, ma'am.

565
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:46,083
What can I get you? Coffee?

566
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:49,583
I would love some coffee.

567
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:10,250
Sugar? Milk?

568
01:07:10,792 --> 01:07:12,708
Black's good.

569
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:48,167
The coffee's great.

570
01:07:48,667 --> 01:07:49,958
Thank you.

571
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:56,667
Daani can practice the piano here.
It'll be more convenient.

572
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,500
Drink up! The coffee will get cold.

573
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:14,083
Ma'am, let me get some biscuits.

574
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:17,500
That's it! | just knew it.

575
01:08:19,667 --> 01:08:20,792
Stop play-acting!

576
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,458
Take off those glasses.

577
01:08:28,583 --> 01:08:30,417
Mister Fake—Blind...

578
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:35,708
...meet Fake—Gun!

579
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:51,625
Oh God!

580
01:08:52,792 --> 01:08:56,458
Ma'am, I'm sorry. I don't want
to get mixed up in all this.

581
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:58,750
You should've sent me away
that day.

582
01:08:59,125 --> 01:09:00,583
I thought you were blind.

583
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:04,750
And Mrs. D'Sa, she was listening
to every word. She's dead now.

584
01:09:07,167 --> 01:09:08,458
What's your game?

585
01:09:08,667 --> 01:09:12,750
It‘s an experiment. I figured
I'd play better if I could not see.

586
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:13,917
I'm an artist.

587
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:16,583
I had this crazy idea.

588
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,083
I thought it was harmless.

589
01:09:22,417 --> 01:09:25,000
How many people know
about this experiment?

590
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:28,042
I swear on Goddess Saraswati,
nobody knows.

591
01:09:28,417 --> 01:09:30,583
Believe me,
I won't make trouble for you.

592
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,083
I gave in my statement.

593
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:34,875
I'm going to London
for a competition.

594
01:09:35,167 --> 01:09:37,833
- I'll be gone soon.
- Sit down.

595
01:09:38,417 --> 01:09:39,792
Sit down. Sit!

596
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:46,958
Have you told Daani anything?

597
01:09:49,292 --> 01:09:55,208
Daani‘s father...Pramod...
things were good between us.

598
01:09:56,917 --> 01:09:58,833
Manohar is just a good...

599
01:10:02,542 --> 01:10:04,708
Pammi wanted to surprise me.

600
01:10:06,292 --> 01:10:07,583
But who ended up surprised?

601
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:12,750
Everyone believes I'm blind.
So I saw nothing.

602
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,833
I saw nothing at all.

603
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:17,750
Just calm down. Relax.

604
01:10:18,708 --> 01:10:21,333
|'|| clean this mess.

605
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:34,292
What is it?

606
01:10:37,042 --> 01:10:38,542
What did you put in that prasad?

607
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:41,458
What did you give me?

608
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:47,208
What was in it?

609
01:12:00,167 --> 01:12:01,125
Thank you.

610
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:07,125
Sister! Watch this video.
It'll only cost you 50-rupees.

611
01:12:07,292 --> 01:12:08,208
Clear off!

612
01:12:08,375 --> 01:12:12,458
Breaking news! OK.
Pay me later.

613
01:12:22,833 --> 01:12:23,833
My money!

614
01:12:24,667 --> 01:12:25,583
Sister!

615
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,042
Akash...

616
01:13:10,792 --> 01:13:11,875
Akash!

617
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:30,292
It's not what you think.

618
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:35,542
After Pramod was gone, I felt so alone.

619
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:39,417
I came to rely on Akash.

620
01:13:39,917 --> 01:13:43,250
- And you know Akash is so...
- ...sensitive.

621
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:45,083
Yes.

622
01:13:45,417 --> 01:13:46,958
So emotional.

623
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:49,875
Also wild in bed.

624
01:13:51,542 --> 01:13:54,875
Did he spin that yarn to you
about the cricket ball?

625
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:56,417
Yes.

626
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:01,333
He is not blind.

627
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:04,667
What? He isn't blind?

628
01:14:05,042 --> 01:14:07,917
- Not at all. | just found out.
— How?

629
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:10,542
Ask that kid downstairs.

630
01:14:12,917 --> 01:14:15,000
Blast it! Why ask me?

631
01:14:16,542 --> 01:14:17,875
Oh my God!

632
01:14:22,042 --> 01:14:25,250
I had better go.

633
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:27,958
No. You stay.

634
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,875
Give him a message from me.

635
01:14:36,167 --> 01:14:38,875
Franco has sold the piano...

636
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:41,583
...so his services are no longer
required.

637
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:53,833
Sister, my money!

638
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:34,167
- What is it?
— What have you done to me?

639
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,250
Ican't see a thing. Nothing.

640
01:16:40,917 --> 01:16:43,167
But you've been blind for years.

641
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:46,083
| read an article about you
in the papers.

642
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:48,208
How could you do this to me?

643
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:53,542
How could anyone do such a thing?
It's wrong, it's evil.

644
01:16:54,208 --> 01:16:57,083
What did you put in my eyes?
Make them all right.

645
01:16:57,250 --> 01:17:00,667
Take me to a doctor at once.

646
01:17:01,042 --> 01:17:02,375
Or else I'll tell everyone.

647
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:04,875
Be my guest. Tell them.

648
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:08,042
Tell the press. Give the police
another statement.

649
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:11,458
"Simi Sinha murdered Pramod Sinha
and blinded me."

650
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:15,417
We'll see who believes you.
Good luck.

651
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:23,500
| suggest you focus on your music.
You're an artist after all.

652
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:44,208
What's on your phone?

653
01:17:44,542 --> 01:17:46,083
A video. Want to see it?

654
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,375
- Where is it?
— Look, it's here.

655
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:56,125
Where's it gone?

656
01:17:57,833 --> 01:17:59,042
My money!

657
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:02,792
Listen to me.

658
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:08,458
I know you aren't blind. Who else
are you sleeping with besides Simi?

659
01:18:08,667 --> 01:18:11,250
- Sophie. let me explain.
— Dare call me again...

660
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:13,500
...and I'll report you to the police.

661
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:16,417
You've broken my heart.
Now write a song about that.

662
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:18,208
Go to hell!

663
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,917
You blinded him? What do you mean?
How?

664
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:08,625
There are a 100 ways on the Net.

665
01:19:09,083 --> 01:19:10,833
Good. Now he's really blind.

666
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,458
But the blind can talk.
He can talk to the press.

667
01:19:13,625 --> 01:19:16,208
If there's an enquiry, I'll get the boot.
We'll get caught.

668
01:19:16,375 --> 01:19:17,542
You should've killed him.

669
01:19:17,958 --> 01:19:20,667
I'm not a serial killer to bump
them off, one by one.

670
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:24,833
Keep playing the perfect husband.
Hide behind your wife.

671
01:19:25,292 --> 01:19:26,917
Why didn't you take my call?

672
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:29,500
My wife's aunt was in the ICU.

673
01:19:29,875 --> 01:19:31,667
You know the score, you're married.

674
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:35,458
l was. And to a far better man
than you.

675
01:19:36,542 --> 01:19:39,000
Why did you bring your gun
that day?

676
01:19:39,583 --> 01:19:41,583
If you hadn't, none of this
would've happened.

677
01:19:42,167 --> 01:19:44,875
He might even have forgiven me.

678
01:19:45,542 --> 01:19:49,792
You think you're "Dirty Harry."
While I do the dirty work.

679
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:21,875
Open the door!

680
01:22:44,708 --> 01:22:46,792
Who is it?

681
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:49,333
Don't touch me.

682
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:51,500
Relax, Mr. Akash. Relax.

683
01:22:51,792 --> 01:22:53,875
I'm Dr Swami.
You're in my clinic.

684
01:22:54,042 --> 01:22:55,583
You were lying on the street.

685
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:58,958
- Who brought me here?
— Me. Murli, the auto driver.

686
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:02,125
Sir, we found your passport
in your pocket.

687
01:23:02,292 --> 01:23:04,875
6,000 in cash.
We've kept them safely for you.

688
01:23:05,708 --> 01:23:07,125
Are you a doctor?

689
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:09,583
Sir, my eyes have been damaged.
Help me.

690
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:14,292
- The poor man is blind.
— I can't see a thing. My eyes...

691
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:17,667
Looks like a recent injury.

692
01:23:18,167 --> 01:23:19,625
The cornea's damaged.

693
01:23:19,875 --> 01:23:22,542
- An eye specialist can help you.
- Take me to him.

694
01:23:22,542 --> 01:23:24,958
- Take me to him.
— Take you where?

695
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:27,083
You're already in hospital.

696
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:29,875
- Dr Ambike will examine you.
— When does he come?

697
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:32,125
This evening, at 7.

698
01:23:32,292 --> 01:23:35,542
Relax till then. Let me give you
a tetanus shot.

699
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,292
Your hand. Clench your wrist. Bravo!

700
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:42,083
Just relax.

701
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:46,042
Relax.

702
01:23:59,083 --> 01:24:04,500
Murli, when you picked me up,
was anyone else there?

703
01:24:04,667 --> 01:24:06,417
N0, why?

704
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:09,375
Someone wants to kill me.

705
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,625
Are you in trouble? I dropped you
at the police station the other day.

706
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:25,125
Eat up, sir.

707
01:24:28,583 --> 01:24:30,250
I've met you before.

708
01:24:30,542 --> 01:24:34,417
You helped me sell a lottery ticket.

709
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:36,917
- Near the tea stall on M.G.Road?
— Yes, sir.

710
01:24:37,833 --> 01:24:42,208
You bring luck, sir. The ticket won
the fellow 10,000.

711
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:46,083
- What's the number?
- Number?

712
01:24:46,542 --> 01:24:50,250
- Don't you want to call someone?
- No.

713
01:24:53,208 --> 01:24:55,083
No family? Have you no one?

714
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:58,667
Afriend, girlfriend, boyfriend?
You must have someone...

715
01:24:58,833 --> 01:25:01,417
- ...to help you.
- I said no.

716
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:04,750
Tell me when the doctor comes.

717
01:25:06,458 --> 01:25:07,250
Yes, sir.

718
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:13,167
Tell you what. Take this pill
after you've eaten.

719
01:25:14,333 --> 01:25:15,542
Get some sleep.

720
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:32,625
Fetch my things from the car.

721
01:25:34,417 --> 01:25:35,750
150,000.

722
01:25:36,458 --> 01:25:37,750
50,000 advance.

723
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:42,958
200,000 or I'll call it off.

724
01:25:43,125 --> 01:25:46,958
Call what off?
What use is that blind fellow to you?

725
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:51,625
The price is fair. OK. 200,000.

726
01:25:51,792 --> 01:25:54,083
50,000 advance. But for both kidneys.

727
01:25:55,042 --> 01:25:56,167
Done.

728
01:25:57,792 --> 01:25:59,625
Both kidneys? He'll die.

729
01:25:59,917 --> 01:26:04,083
So what? Throw his body
onto the railway tracks.

730
01:26:04,458 --> 01:26:06,958
A few trains run over him,
he'll be so mutilated...

731
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:09,458
...no one will know if he
had any kidneys.

732
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:11,833
I'm going to see the patient now.

733
01:26:13,625 --> 01:26:14,708
Are you OK with this?

734
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,833
Were you OK when your mother
had to beg to feed you?

735
01:26:18,042 --> 01:26:21,042
Drop it. We're getting 200,000
because he's in good health.

736
01:26:21,208 --> 01:26:25,417
- What difference does it make?
— Leave the poor man one kidney.

737
01:26:27,333 --> 01:26:28,250
Akash.

738
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,542
Doctor, is the eye specialist here?

739
01:26:30,708 --> 01:26:33,875
He'll be here soon enough.
Meanwhile we'll scan your body.

740
01:26:41,458 --> 01:26:43,083
Sit down. Put the light on.

741
01:26:43,458 --> 01:26:45,458
Sir, why is there no one
in your hospital?

742
01:26:45,625 --> 01:26:48,375
Am I the only patient here?
It's so quiet.

743
01:26:48,542 --> 01:26:51,208
This place is history now.

744
01:26:51,208 --> 01:26:54,042
There's a new hospital near the highway.
Everyone goes there.

745
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,542
Now this old is no more gold.

746
01:26:59,875 --> 01:27:01,208
Take off your shirt...

747
01:27:05,667 --> 01:27:07,125
...and your watch.

748
01:27:08,292 --> 01:27:09,667
Loosen your trousers.

749
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:12,208
Lie down.

750
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:20,917
Lie on your stomach. Well done!
Loosen your trousers a little.

751
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:27,792
Well done.

752
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:38,417
Must you call now?
I cut the cable connection.

753
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:41,417
No TV till our son's exams.
No more soaps for you either.

754
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:43,250
Help him prep for his exams.

755
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:46,083
How many times have I told you not
to disturb me during an operation?

756
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:48,000
I'll call you later.

757
01:27:48,167 --> 01:27:50,417
What operation? What for?

758
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:53,458
- Where is Dr Ambike?
- Just lie down.

759
01:27:56,625 --> 01:27:58,167
Take one kidney only.

760
01:27:59,417 --> 01:28:00,750
One kidney is enough, sir.

761
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:07,917
- Come here, fast.
— He's kicking like a horse.

762
01:28:08,083 --> 01:28:10,958
- 100,000 is enough.
— Get off me!

763
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:15,083
- 100,000 is enough.
— I'll give you ten million.

764
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:18,000
I swear on the Lord Shiva tattoo
on your hand.

765
01:28:18,458 --> 01:28:21,167
I promise to God. I'll give you
ten million.

766
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:02,667
Ten million?

767
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:05,167
One minute.

768
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:11,625
Doctor, how does he know
I have a Lord Shiva tattoo?

769
01:29:12,333 --> 01:29:16,083
Hail to Lord Shiva.

770
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:20,292
You are the mightiest of them all.

771
01:29:26,125 --> 01:29:28,875
Hello, Mr. Akash.

772
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:33,708
Get up!

773
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,292
Everything is all right, brother.

774
01:29:41,958 --> 01:29:46,167
- No harm has come to you.
- Relax! Everything is fine.

775
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,542
Good morning!

776
01:29:51,458 --> 01:29:53,250
It's all OK, brother.

777
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:55,708
You're a lucky fellow.

778
01:29:56,542 --> 01:29:59,208
The doctor was planning to remove
both your kidneys...

779
01:29:59,625 --> 01:30:01,917
...and pay us 200,000 for them.

780
01:30:04,667 --> 01:30:08,583
Then you started blabbering
about ten million.

781
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:15,750
How did you know
I have a Lord Shiva tattoo?

782
01:30:16,792 --> 01:30:20,042
You wear sarees, right?
You have black hair.

783
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:22,625
You look like athlete PT Usha's
younger sister.

784
01:30:23,833 --> 01:30:26,333
Murli, you're smaller than aunty...

785
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:29,458
...both in height and years.

786
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:32,792
You've got hair like Malinga,
the fast bowler.

787
01:30:33,583 --> 01:30:37,333
You're an Aishwarya Rai fan.
You stuck a picture of her on your auto.

788
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,792
Oh my God! He has a third eye.

789
01:30:41,125 --> 01:30:43,958
Murli, he's a reincarnation
of Lord Shiva.

790
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:46,750
Hold on!

791
01:30:47,583 --> 01:30:50,167
Are you pretending to be blind?

792
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,750
- Aunt!
— Yes, brother?

793
01:30:54,292 --> 01:30:56,583
I'm the biggest jackpot
you'll ever win.

794
01:30:58,125 --> 01:30:59,375
Meaning what?

795
01:31:21,958 --> 01:31:22,917
Hello, madam.

796
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:26,208
Can I check Mr. Sinha's call data?

797
01:31:27,708 --> 01:31:28,875
- Take a seat.
— Thank you, ma'am.

798
01:31:29,042 --> 01:31:30,375
Go outside.

799
01:31:36,667 --> 01:31:37,750
How did that happen?

800
01:31:38,708 --> 01:31:41,250
A terrorist was gunned down.
Routine police work.

801
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:44,875
It must hurt a lot.

802
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:49,292
Not especially. Akash is at large.
We're tracking him.

803
01:31:50,292 --> 01:31:52,792
We've tapped his girlfriend's phone.

804
01:31:58,167 --> 01:31:59,958
Everything now belongs to you.

805
01:32:00,292 --> 01:32:02,333
The blind can talk, you know!

806
01:32:04,375 --> 01:32:05,708
Find him!

807
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:28,250
Hello, Akash.

808
01:32:30,292 --> 01:32:33,583
Mrs. Sinha,
I'm going to London tomorrow.

809
01:32:34,833 --> 01:32:37,083
I wanted to see Daani and tell her...

810
01:32:37,458 --> 01:32:39,083
...to keep practicing.

811
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:42,250
Take care and stay in touch.

812
01:32:42,667 --> 01:32:46,000
- I'll be off.
— Can I drop you somewhere?

813
01:32:46,917 --> 01:32:47,917
Sure.

814
01:32:50,875 --> 01:32:54,208
- Want some Chinese take-away?
- Whatever you like.

815
01:33:06,125 --> 01:33:07,125
Pick up, pick up!

816
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:11,792
Akash is in my car.
What now?

817
01:33:11,792 --> 01:33:15,375
Bring him to Range Hills Cemetery.
|'|| bury him there.

818
01:33:17,542 --> 01:33:20,875
My wife's aunt is in the ICU again.
Got to run.

819
01:33:24,042 --> 01:33:25,208
Now talk!

820
01:33:26,375 --> 01:33:28,375
I said I'd leave town.

821
01:33:29,875 --> 01:33:31,667
You still chose to blind me.

822
01:33:32,667 --> 01:33:34,667
And that cop boyfriend of yours...

823
01:33:34,958 --> 01:33:37,417
...he was trying to get me.
He wanted to kill me.

824
01:33:37,708 --> 01:33:40,250
I've been sleeping at the bus stand
for the last 2 nights.

825
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,750
- Did Manohar attack you?
- So you don't know?

826
01:33:45,958 --> 01:33:48,042
I want my eyesight back.

827
01:33:50,042 --> 01:33:54,417
A doctor said I could regain it
with a cornea transplant.

828
01:33:54,625 --> 01:33:57,333
It's a million rupees
on the black market.

829
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:02,125
Give me the money. I'll have
the operation and leave for London.

830
01:34:08,083 --> 01:34:09,667
Get what I'm saying?

831
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:13,625
Can you hear me?

832
01:34:17,625 --> 01:34:20,542
A million. Or you‘ll be behind bars.

833
01:34:22,167 --> 01:34:23,708
I'll start babbling to the press.

834
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:26,708
- Blackmail?
— Compensation.

835
01:34:30,417 --> 01:34:34,250
I don't have that kind of money.
Besides, why would I give it to you?

836
01:34:48,292 --> 01:34:50,458
Move! You're holding us up.

837
01:34:51,208 --> 01:34:52,292
What is it?

838
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:54,792
An auto‘s blocking the way.

839
01:34:55,458 --> 01:34:57,708
Does it have an image of Aishwarya?

840
01:35:00,333 --> 01:35:01,708
You can see again?

841
01:35:31,083 --> 01:35:34,417
The number you're trying to reach
is currently unavailable.

842
01:35:34,625 --> 01:35:35,833
Good evening.

843
01:35:38,375 --> 01:35:41,417
I made some rice flakes, Chinese style.
Tell me if they're good.

844
01:35:43,542 --> 01:35:45,750
Who gave this to you?

845
01:35:47,083 --> 01:35:48,167
What's the matter?

846
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:50,458
Not feeling well?

847
01:35:50,792 --> 01:35:51,875
Does it hurt?

848
01:35:53,875 --> 01:35:55,250
Eat up. I'll get it.

849
01:35:55,417 --> 01:35:57,000
How does it taste?

850
01:35:59,292 --> 01:36:00,500
Superb!

851
01:36:06,167 --> 01:36:07,917
Private detective Ismail.

852
01:36:07,917 --> 01:36:10,208
- Can I talk to Rasikaji?
— I'm Rasika.

853
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:15,292
The actor Pramod Sinha hired me.

854
01:36:15,292 --> 01:36:17,833
He had this hunch
his wife was having an affair.

855
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:18,750
Manu!

856
01:36:18,917 --> 01:36:21,625
l tailed her for 2 weeks.
Filmed her, took photos.

857
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,958
Pramod Sinha has died.
80 who pays my fees?

858
01:36:26,375 --> 01:36:28,792
It's not my problem.
How should I know?

859
01:36:29,083 --> 01:36:31,583
Your husband was sleeping
with Mrs. Sinha.

860
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,167
That's why.

861
01:36:33,167 --> 01:36:34,208
Who is it?

862
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,125
- Mallika.
— Say hi from me.

863
01:36:42,083 --> 01:36:43,833
Have you any idea
who my husband is?

864
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:46,750
- If he finds out...
— I know who he is.

865
01:36:47,292 --> 01:36:52,875
But you don't know he bumped
Sinha off for ten million.

866
01:36:53,625 --> 01:36:56,167
I'll call tomorrow at 9:30.

867
01:36:57,125 --> 01:36:58,875
I want that ten million.

868
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:02,458
The press pays a bomb
for stories like this.

869
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:06,458
"The nation wants to know
who killed Pramod Sinha?"

870
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,125
Good night.

871
01:37:10,375 --> 01:37:14,458
Well done, my man.
Time for a selfie!

872
01:37:18,125 --> 01:37:19,542
Smile, please!

873
01:37:20,458 --> 01:37:21,750
You'll hurt me. What are you doing?

874
01:37:21,917 --> 01:37:23,833
Come out! You dog!

875
01:37:24,208 --> 01:37:26,958
Come out or I'll kill you.

876
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:29,292
That's a real gun.

877
01:37:29,625 --> 01:37:31,542
No need to fast anymore
for an idiot husband.

878
01:37:32,042 --> 01:37:34,458
16 eggs 3 day? To service her?

879
01:37:35,167 --> 01:37:38,500
To enjoy your time
with that cheap actress Simi.

880
01:37:38,667 --> 01:37:42,042
I'm a fool. I'm not smart.
She‘s shrewd. I hate her.

881
01:37:42,375 --> 01:37:43,458
She trapped me.

882
01:37:43,625 --> 01:37:46,667
Are you a kid? Didn't you realize
she was trapping you?

883
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:48,333
Honey, let's not talk about her.

884
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:50,250
I messed up, big time.

885
01:37:50,792 --> 01:37:53,000
There's only one person I love.

886
01:37:53,167 --> 01:37:56,583
And that's you. I love you, Russu.

887
01:37:56,750 --> 01:38:00,208
Blast your Russu! She's burning
on a funeral pyre.

888
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:02,000
Don‘t say that. I love you.

889
01:38:02,625 --> 01:38:05,083
You lowlife! Come out of there.

890
01:38:05,458 --> 01:38:06,625
Come out!

891
01:38:08,583 --> 01:38:12,500
I'm coming out now. OK, Russu?

892
01:38:13,708 --> 01:38:16,625
Don't shoot.
I'm coming out.

893
01:38:18,458 --> 01:38:20,500
That's her again.

894
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,917
No, it's my sub-inspector.
Let me take the call.

895
01:38:26,083 --> 01:38:28,583
Don't shoot.
It's on the speakerphone.

896
01:38:28,917 --> 01:38:29,917
Yes, Paresh?

897
01:38:30,083 --> 01:38:34,000
Sir, we've found Simi Sinha’s car
at Suicide Point.

898
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,542
We found her bag
and a shoe near the car.

899
01:38:37,583 --> 01:38:39,375
Looks like she jumped, sir.

900
01:38:39,833 --> 01:38:42,083
We haven't found a suicide note.

901
01:38:42,292 --> 01:38:46,708
We 're searching the river.
But it's teeming with crocodiles.

902
01:38:48,042 --> 01:38:50,250
Sir? Hello.

903
01:38:56,292 --> 01:39:00,375
Simi Sinha, the widow of actor
Pramod Sinha has committed suicide.

904
01:39:00,542 --> 01:39:04,750
I'm standing on Pune's lndrayani bridge
Where a bag and a shoe...

905
01:39:04,917 --> 01:39:08,083
...were found near Mrs. Sinha's car.

906
01:39:08,083 --> 01:39:12,583
Pramod Sinha’s body was also discovered
nearby a few days ago.

907
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:18,167
The police believe Mrs. Sinha
jumped from this bridge.

908
01:39:18,875 --> 01:39:23,125
Simi's step-daughter, Daani,
told the press...

909
01:39:23,292 --> 01:39:27,417
...she last saw Simi leave home
with the piano teacher Akash.

910
01:39:27,583 --> 01:39:30,667
At this point, Akash’s whereabouts
are unknown.

911
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,333
They've eloped!

912
01:39:42,167 --> 01:39:44,000
Simi Sinha had ambitions of acting.

913
01:39:44,167 --> 01:39:48,667
And to achieve this, she married
the much older actor Sinha.

914
01:39:49,708 --> 01:39:54,792
After Pramod Sinha died, Simi's dream
of setting the box-office on fire failed.

915
01:39:55,333 --> 01:39:57,875
This failure probably...

916
01:39:58,042 --> 01:40:01,292
...drove Simi to drown herself.

917
01:40:01,542 --> 01:40:06,083
Pramod Sinha’s murder has not been
solved and now...

918
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:18,167
Crying over your own death?

919
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:31,417
He's a doctor.

920
01:40:31,625 --> 01:40:33,333
He'll take a blood test.

921
01:40:33,792 --> 01:40:37,417
If our blood group matches,
he'll use your cornea for the transplant.

922
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,250
You want to save your eyes? Return the
ten million your husband had.

923
01:40:54,542 --> 01:40:56,083
Hey, doctor!

924
01:40:56,375 --> 01:40:57,542
What's your name?

925
01:40:58,917 --> 01:41:00,458
Swami.

926
01:41:00,917 --> 01:41:03,083
OK, Swamiji...

927
01:41:05,208 --> 01:41:08,167
Listen to him and you'll be in trouble.
The police are looking for him.

928
01:41:08,375 --> 01:41:12,417
You want money. I'll give it
to you. Just untie me!

929
01:41:12,625 --> 01:41:14,542
Madam, who'll believe you?

930
01:41:14,958 --> 01:41:17,667
You‘re evil. You killed
your own husband.

931
01:41:18,458 --> 01:41:22,875
- I didn't kill Pramod.
— I saw it with my own two eyes.

932
01:41:23,333 --> 01:41:26,625
You and Manohar stuffed
Sinha's body in a bag.

933
01:41:26,792 --> 01:41:28,708
You know zilch.
You arrived later.

934
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:32,125
That stupid Pramod lied to me,
said he was going to Bengaluru.

935
01:41:32,333 --> 01:41:33,583
But he came back to surprise me.

936
01:41:33,958 --> 01:41:36,167
Pramod picked up Manohar‘s gun...

937
01:41:36,167 --> 01:41:38,542
...I was explaining things.
The gun went off by accident.

938
01:41:39,583 --> 01:41:40,958
And Mrs. D'Sa?

939
01:41:42,542 --> 01:41:44,792
Are you a bunch of saints?

940
01:41:45,125 --> 01:41:48,750
Yes, I pushed her.
What if she identified Manohar?

941
01:41:51,792 --> 01:41:55,208
Yes, / pushed her.
What if she identified Manohar?

942
01:42:00,458 --> 01:42:01,875
Thank you, Mrs. Sinha.

943
01:42:03,042 --> 01:42:05,458
If we don't get paid,
your confession ends up...

944
01:42:05,625 --> 01:42:08,292
...with the press, the police
and Pramod's daughter, Daani.

945
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:12,458
Manohar was right.

946
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:17,708
I shouldn't have blinded you.
I should've killed you.

947
01:42:18,167 --> 01:42:19,292
Untie me!

948
01:42:20,458 --> 01:42:22,333
Are you a complete idiot?

949
01:42:22,917 --> 01:42:25,125
If we untied the blindfold,
you could identify us.

950
01:42:25,417 --> 01:42:26,917
We'd have to kill you.

951
01:42:27,167 --> 01:42:28,833
Stay calm and listen.

952
01:42:29,083 --> 01:42:31,042
I‘ll get you breakfast.
And take you to the toilet.

953
01:42:38,792 --> 01:42:40,875
Stop. This is the top floor.

954
01:42:41,417 --> 01:42:44,042
Murli, you stay here.
And Aunty, you?

955
01:42:44,458 --> 01:42:48,833
I'll wait downstairs. If anyone asks,
I'll say I'm the cleaner.

956
01:42:50,375 --> 01:42:54,792
- We have to trap him in the lift.
- |'|| switch the power off.

957
01:42:55,167 --> 01:42:58,625
The tiger is trapped in his cage.
The monkeys are on a rampage.

958
01:42:58,792 --> 01:43:02,250
- Let's shake on it!
— There goes the building.

959
01:43:04,292 --> 01:43:06,333
I want to hear Manohar scream.

960
01:43:08,042 --> 01:43:09,542
Record him.

961
01:43:11,667 --> 01:43:14,333
She drinks gallons of coconut water
and just keeps peeing.

962
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:18,042
Does Dr. Ambike even exist?

963
01:43:19,208 --> 01:43:22,708
There must be 100 Dr. Ambikes in Pune.

964
01:43:24,417 --> 01:43:25,750
What's so funny?

965
01:43:29,417 --> 01:43:34,375
How many times must I tell you?
There is no missing money.

966
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:40,792
- On TV you said it was missing.
— Because it's on TV doesn't make it true.

967
01:43:42,375 --> 01:43:45,792
Sister! I am a widow.

968
01:43:46,833 --> 01:43:51,167
My daughter is all alone at home.
Help me, please.

969
01:43:52,125 --> 01:43:54,333
Once we get the ten million...

970
01:43:54,958 --> 01:43:56,458
...we'll see.

971
01:43:59,375 --> 01:44:01,125
Help!

972
01:44:15,083 --> 01:44:17,708
Help! Someone help me.

973
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,542
The next train arrives in an hour.
Try again.

974
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:45,833
What use is courage or a heart?
The kidneys are the dearest part

975
01:44:58,250 --> 01:45:01,417
Enmity comes free

976
01:45:01,583 --> 01:45:04,875
Friendship charges a fee

977
01:45:14,917 --> 01:45:17,750
Is it a heart or a black hole?

978
01:46:04,208 --> 01:46:05,917
Hello, Mrs. Manohar.

979
01:46:06,625 --> 01:46:09,875
Mrs. Ismail here.
Is the money ready?

980
01:46:10,208 --> 01:46:12,417
Yes. Where shall I bring it?

981
01:46:12,625 --> 01:46:16,250
Not you.
Send your cop husband.

982
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:19,792
I'll text him the address.
I'm hanging up.

983
01:46:26,333 --> 01:46:30,333
Go, clean up the mess you've made.

984
01:46:41,875 --> 01:46:43,250
Come on.

985
01:46:49,792 --> 01:46:53,125
He's a cop. He's smart.
Do as I told you.

986
01:46:55,167 --> 01:46:56,917
Sit down.

987
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Why are you tying me up, aunty?

988
01:47:07,167 --> 01:47:10,792
Easy does it.
It's for your own good.

989
01:47:10,958 --> 01:47:12,750
Murli, what's all this?

990
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,375
There's a lot ofjunk here.
You'll hurt yourself.

991
01:47:16,542 --> 01:47:20,625
I'm not crazy to try running.
I trusted you.

992
01:47:21,167 --> 01:47:23,750
I don't know what you're up to.

993
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:26,083
Untie me.

994
01:47:35,292 --> 01:47:37,125
How can you do this?

995
01:47:37,458 --> 01:47:39,792
Murli! Aunty!

996
01:47:47,792 --> 01:47:51,417
The monkeys have tied up their master
and scooted.

997
01:47:52,458 --> 01:47:57,917
So you really think they'll return
with Manohar's money?

998
01:48:00,375 --> 01:48:03,875
Manohar is going to whip
your motley gang.

999
01:48:04,375 --> 01:48:06,208
He'll whip you too.

1000
01:48:08,625 --> 01:48:11,375
Cat got your tongue?

1001
01:48:14,125 --> 01:48:15,667
Just wondering...

1002
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,208
...what Manohar will do to you.

1003
01:48:20,042 --> 01:48:22,000
Will he hug you? Or shoot you?

1004
01:48:23,292 --> 01:48:25,583
You're a liability now.

1005
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:34,708
Cat got your tongue now?

1006
01:48:43,667 --> 01:48:47,125
- Akash, come closer to me.
- Why?

1007
01:48:49,708 --> 01:48:51,708
Because.

1008
01:48:53,667 --> 01:48:55,500
...we have to help each other.

1009
01:48:56,667 --> 01:48:58,500
I can untie your hands.

1010
01:48:59,042 --> 01:49:00,333
And in return?

1011
01:49:00,958 --> 01:49:03,458
In return?
You take the band off my eyes.

1012
01:49:03,625 --> 01:49:05,458
I don't want your help.

1013
01:49:06,458 --> 01:49:08,458
You fool, what's your plan?

1014
01:49:08,958 --> 01:49:10,917
Prefer waiting here for "the end?"

1015
01:49:11,208 --> 01:49:12,708
When Manohar shows up...

1016
01:49:13,292 --> 01:49:16,417
...|‘|| find a way to save my skin.
Either way you've had it.

1017
01:49:17,958 --> 01:49:19,042
Where are you?

1018
01:49:26,708 --> 01:49:27,500
Akash!

1019
01:49:27,667 --> 01:49:31,708
Our meeting was a dream

1020
01:49:33,375 --> 01:49:37,292
You got What was coming to you

1021
01:49:37,458 --> 01:49:39,667
Is that the only song
you can sing now?

1022
01:49:40,375 --> 01:49:44,333
I will never come back
to see you again

1023
01:49:59,083 --> 01:50:00,208
Listen...

1024
01:50:01,417 --> 01:50:03,750
Even if Manohar coughs up the money...

1025
01:50:04,042 --> 01:50:07,250
...I don't think they'll free us.
What's your hunch?

1026
01:50:07,917 --> 01:50:11,833
Murli‘s OK. Can't tell about aunty.
The doctor's the dangerous one.

1027
01:50:12,125 --> 01:50:15,125
I cut the cable connection.
I'm selling the TV next.

1028
01:50:15,292 --> 01:50:17,292
Then Mummy and I will
stay with grandma.

1029
01:50:17,458 --> 01:50:22,000
Give it here. What marks did you
get for maths? Get your mother!

1030
01:50:22,417 --> 01:50:24,542
- What is it?
— Here are the blood sample reports.

1031
01:50:30,458 --> 01:50:31,667
Something wrong, sir?

1032
01:50:46,042 --> 01:50:47,625
Go inside the building.

1033
01:50:47,625 --> 01:50:50,375
Leave the bag in the lift.
Once I get the money...

1034
01:50:50,542 --> 01:50:51,542
...the evidence comes down.

1035
01:50:51,708 --> 01:50:55,375
No dirty tricks. Or else you can
watch your story on TV tonight.

1036
01:51:51,417 --> 01:51:53,417
Ismail, hands up!

1037
01:51:55,208 --> 01:51:56,000
Stop!

1038
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,042
Stop!

1039
01:52:11,208 --> 01:52:12,958
- Where's the evidence?
- I don't have it.

1040
01:52:13,208 --> 01:52:14,750
- Who has it?
- Sakku.

1041
01:52:14,917 --> 01:52:17,875
- Where is she?
— In the basement.

1042
01:52:19,958 --> 01:52:20,958
Murli, are you OK?

1043
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,167
Murli, what was that sound?

1044
01:52:30,583 --> 01:52:33,333
We've got the cash.
He's in the lift.

1045
01:52:44,417 --> 01:52:47,750
Help! Let me out!

1046
01:52:49,833 --> 01:52:50,833
Let me out.

1047
01:53:11,125 --> 01:53:12,708
What's your plan?

1048
01:53:13,125 --> 01:53:16,917
There's a bathroom with an open window.
The railway station's nearby.

1049
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:22,458
You OK?

1050
01:53:24,292 --> 01:53:25,542
Come here!

1051
01:53:26,625 --> 01:53:28,917
- Take the band off, Akash.
- No.

1052
01:53:29,250 --> 01:53:32,333
I can help you to find the way out.
We're running out of time.

1053
01:53:38,083 --> 01:53:41,375
Take the band off.
So don't untie my hands.

1054
01:53:41,917 --> 01:53:44,500
Time's running out.
I'll guide you.

1055
01:53:48,208 --> 01:53:53,292
Take the band off. For goodness sake,
I can guide you.

1056
01:54:07,792 --> 01:54:11,500
- We're in some sort of storeroom.
— Are the windows closed?

1057
01:54:11,667 --> 01:54:14,250
Yes. No sign of a door or bathroom.

1058
01:54:18,333 --> 01:54:22,000
There's a glass partition.
Can you break it?

1059
01:54:23,292 --> 01:54:24,750
- Where is it?
— Ahead of you.

1060
01:54:25,917 --> 01:54:27,500
Walk a few steps. Found it?

1061
01:54:32,625 --> 01:54:34,500
- Where?
- Ahead.

1062
01:54:34,667 --> 01:54:37,167
Ahead where? Right? Left?
Be clear.

1063
01:54:37,333 --> 01:54:40,333
Straight ahead...now turn around.

1064
01:54:45,542 --> 01:54:47,750
Here? What's this?

1065
01:54:48,292 --> 01:54:49,875
The bed frame.

1066
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:01,542
- What are you up to?
— Nothing. Turn right.

1067
01:55:10,958 --> 01:55:13,792
We're nearly at the hospital.

1068
01:55:14,375 --> 01:55:16,833
Murli, keep talking.
Don't fall asleep.

1069
01:55:20,875 --> 01:55:21,917
Murli!

1070
01:55:22,875 --> 01:55:26,000
What's wrong?
He has no pulse. Start CPR.

1071
01:55:26,917 --> 01:55:30,458
- Don't stop talking, Murli.
- Step outside. Please.

1072
01:55:34,417 --> 01:55:37,167
Bend down, lower! A little more.

1073
01:55:37,583 --> 01:55:40,375
It's a fire extinguisher.
Pick it up.

1074
01:55:41,792 --> 01:55:44,458
Break the glass partition with it.

1075
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:47,542
Throw it. Not towards me!

1076
01:55:47,833 --> 01:55:48,792
I'm right here.

1077
01:55:49,167 --> 01:55:50,333
Face the other way.

1078
01:55:53,042 --> 01:55:53,833
What?

1079
01:55:53,833 --> 01:55:57,375
Walk straight ahead.
Veer slightly to your left.

1080
01:56:00,125 --> 01:56:01,667
Shall I throw it?

1081
01:56:06,958 --> 01:56:08,083
It's smashed.

1082
01:56:08,750 --> 01:56:12,000
Where are you going now? Careful.
There's broken glass everywhere.

1083
01:56:12,250 --> 01:56:15,375
There's some cloth on the bed
to your left.

1084
01:56:16,625 --> 01:56:18,292
Wrap it round your hands.

1085
01:56:40,042 --> 01:56:43,708
Mrs. Sinha, will you come with me
to the police station?

1086
01:57:22,333 --> 01:57:23,042
Akash!

1087
01:57:37,250 --> 01:57:38,875
You drew my blood, you scum.

1088
01:57:39,417 --> 01:57:41,417
Help. Help me!

1089
01:57:42,042 --> 01:57:43,708
The next train‘s in an hour.

1090
01:57:45,292 --> 01:57:46,417
Get off me!

1091
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:53,875
Let go.

1092
01:58:00,375 --> 01:58:02,250
What are you doing?

1093
01:58:04,667 --> 01:58:05,833
Let go.

1094
01:58:23,833 --> 01:58:29,583
You saved my life. I'll help you.
Where are my specs?

1095
01:58:31,625 --> 01:58:34,625
Help me carry her.
She's our jackpot.

1096
01:58:37,125 --> 01:58:38,875
ls Murli OK, doctor?

1097
01:58:39,042 --> 01:58:41,000
I'm sorry. He's lost a lot of blood.

1098
01:58:41,292 --> 01:58:44,542
No! Murli can't die.
He has to live.

1099
01:58:44,708 --> 01:58:48,083
Doctor, I have lots of money.

1100
01:58:48,625 --> 01:58:50,000
Here, take it.

1101
01:58:52,125 --> 01:58:54,917
Please control yourself.

1102
01:58:55,208 --> 01:58:58,625
There's something you can do
if you wish. Donate his organs.

1103
01:59:04,667 --> 01:59:05,833
Yes, Sakku?

1104
01:59:08,875 --> 01:59:12,208
It's a total mess.
They've escaped.

1105
01:59:12,583 --> 01:59:15,625
I'm leaving town.
You lie low for a few months.

1106
01:59:18,333 --> 01:59:19,458
Murli is dead.

1107
01:59:28,125 --> 01:59:29,375
Where are we going?

1108
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,458
To cash in the jackpot.

1109
01:59:32,125 --> 01:59:35,167
A private jet is waiting for us
at Mumbai airport.

1110
01:59:40,125 --> 01:59:42,750
Look...sorry, listen to this.

1111
01:59:43,083 --> 01:59:46,125
Contact Dr. Hussaini.
He '/I take care of everything.

1112
01:59:46,667 --> 01:59:47,958
If the liver matches...

1113
01:59:48,167 --> 01:59:50,333
...l'll wire one million dollars
into your account.

1114
01:59:51,667 --> 01:59:55,208
A million dollars!
I'll give you a share.

1115
01:59:55,833 --> 01:59:58,500
And you can have the best
eye transplant with that money.

1116
01:59:58,792 --> 02:00:00,083
You'll see again.

1117
02:00:00,458 --> 02:00:02,292
I don't get it.

1118
02:00:02,875 --> 02:00:05,875
The Sheikh's daughter needs
a liver transplant.

1119
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:11,000
She has a rare blood type.
B Rh Negative.

1120
02:00:12,125 --> 02:00:14,542
- Guess whose blood matches?
— Mine?

1121
02:00:16,125 --> 02:00:18,917
Would you still be here
if it was your blood?

1122
02:00:19,083 --> 02:00:21,167
It's your Lady Macbeth's blood.

1123
02:00:22,167 --> 02:00:26,625
Remember that blood test we took
to scare her?

1124
02:00:27,542 --> 02:00:32,417
The nurse did a routine check.
We've hit the jackpot!

1125
02:00:35,417 --> 02:00:39,208
If her cornea matches yours,
what more could you want?

1126
02:00:39,542 --> 02:00:41,333
You plan to kill her?

1127
02:00:41,667 --> 02:00:43,167
She'll die anyway.

1128
02:00:44,542 --> 02:00:47,792
What is life?
It all depends on the liver.

1129
02:01:58,458 --> 02:02:02,417
A crazy lovely girl
with dusky skin

1130
02:02:05,792 --> 02:02:10,250
Trembling like a leaf
when she’s angry

1131
02:02:13,042 --> 02:02:16,583
And when she happens
to hear my name...

1132
02:02:20,625 --> 02:02:24,708
...she tries hard to disguise
her feelings

1133
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:32,417
Tell me if you happen
to bump into her

1134
02:02:44,833 --> 02:02:48,250
She wrinkles her eyes
in the bright sunlight

1135
02:02:50,167 --> 02:02:54,333
Takes deep drags of life
as she walks along

1136
02:02:57,458 --> 02:03:01,208
Tell me if you happen
to bump into her

1137
02:04:18,042 --> 02:04:18,750
Sophie?

1138
02:04:21,292 --> 02:04:23,542
You're making a fool of people
here too?

1139
02:04:25,958 --> 02:04:29,000
It's a long story. Coffee?

1140
02:04:32,750 --> 02:04:34,125
Bye, Akash.

1141
02:04:53,333 --> 02:04:54,292
And then?

1142
02:04:57,917 --> 02:04:59,125
She'll die anyway.

1143
02:04:59,792 --> 02:05:02,750
What is life?
It all depends on the liver.

1144
02:05:03,042 --> 02:05:04,583
She confessed in your presence.

1145
02:05:04,958 --> 02:05:08,292
The cops will arrest her soon enough.
So let her go.

1146
02:05:08,750 --> 02:05:12,125
Let go of millions?
How can you feel sorry for her?

1147
02:05:12,958 --> 02:05:16,375
She murdered two people
and blinded you.

1148
02:05:17,667 --> 02:05:20,917
Any court of law would give her
the death penalty.

1149
02:05:21,208 --> 02:05:22,750
It's not just about money.

1150
02:05:24,292 --> 02:05:26,250
The Sheikh's child will get a new life.

1151
02:05:26,625 --> 02:05:28,417
And you'll get your eyesight back.

1152
02:05:28,583 --> 02:05:30,542
And there's the kidneys, too.

1153
02:05:31,042 --> 02:05:35,625
Her death will give new life
to 6 people. Just think!

1154
02:05:54,667 --> 02:05:56,083
Hold this.

1155
02:05:59,208 --> 02:06:01,333
This is wrong. You can't do this.

1156
02:06:01,667 --> 02:06:04,792
There's a bus stop up ahead.
I'll drop you there.

1157
02:06:06,208 --> 02:06:07,125
Thank you.

1158
02:06:07,417 --> 02:06:10,333
Only you.
Because you saved my life.

1159
02:06:10,875 --> 02:06:12,708
Basically, I'm a decent man.

1160
02:06:46,542 --> 02:06:48,000
Doctor, please.

1161
02:06:49,417 --> 02:06:53,458
If we killed her and took her eyes,
I'd never be able to play the piano again.

1162
02:06:56,042 --> 02:06:58,833
I said all that stuff
just to scare her.

1163
02:07:00,042 --> 02:07:01,458
I didn't mean it.

1164
02:07:05,042 --> 02:07:07,750
Why talk about removing
her liver and kidneys?

1165
02:07:10,750 --> 02:07:12,417
I won't let you.

1166
02:07:12,958 --> 02:07:16,875
Can you pull over?
Let us both go.

1167
02:07:21,250 --> 02:07:24,208
Trust me, doctor. I won't tell
a soul about you.

1168
02:07:26,292 --> 02:07:28,000
Dr. Swami, can you hear me?

1169
02:07:35,458 --> 02:07:36,625
Get down!

1170
02:07:39,125 --> 02:07:40,208
Get out.

1171
02:07:41,042 --> 02:07:42,833
Get out now!

1172
02:08:54,708 --> 02:08:58,250
A little later a bus came.
It took me to Mumbai.

1173
02:09:00,750 --> 02:09:02,292
Why didn't you come back to me?

1174
02:09:05,042 --> 02:09:09,000
I didn't have the guts.
I wanted to get away from it all.

1175
02:09:10,583 --> 02:09:12,792
Afriend helped me
to get to London.

1176
02:09:20,875 --> 02:09:22,583
- Sir, is that yours?
- Yeah.

1177
02:09:22,958 --> 02:09:24,292
Thanks.

1178
02:09:25,042 --> 02:09:28,833
Tomorrow I'm giving a concert
on Main Square. Will you come?

1179
02:09:33,458 --> 02:09:35,250
I'm flying back tomorrow.

1180
02:09:37,583 --> 02:09:39,042
But I'll try.

1181
02:09:39,875 --> 02:09:41,583
It was great to see you again.

1182
02:09:43,167 --> 02:09:45,833
She ruined so many lives.

1183
02:09:47,417 --> 02:09:51,083
You should've listened to Dr. Swami
and taken Simi's eyes.
